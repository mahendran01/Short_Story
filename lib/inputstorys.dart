      story:
          "Once, there was a boy who became bored when he watched over the village sheep grazing on the hillside. To entertain himself, he sang out, Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is chasing the sheep When the villagers heard the cry, they ran up the hill to drive the wolf away. But when they arrived, they saw no wolf. The boy was amused when he saw their angry faces.Don’t scream wolf when there is no wolf, boy! the villagers warned. They angrily went back down the hill.Later, the shepherd boy cried out once again, Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is chasing the sheep! To his amusement, the villagers came running up the hill to scare the wolf away.As they saw there was no wolf, they said strictly, Save your frightened cry for when there really is a wolf! Don’t cry ‘wolf’ when there is no wolf!” But the boy grinned at their words while they walked, grumbling down the hill once more.Later, the boy saw a real wolf sneaking around his flock. Alarmed, he jumped on his feet and cried out as loud as he could, “Wolf! Wolf!” But the villagers thought he was fooling them again, and they didn’t come to help.At sunset, the villagers went looking for the boy who hadn’t returned with their sheep. When they went up the hill, they found him weeping.There was a wolf here! The flock is gone! I cried out, Wolf! but you didn’t come,he wailed.An older man went to comfort the boy. As he put his arm around him, he said, Nobody believes a liar, even when he is telling the truth!"),

          "Once upon a time, in a desert far away, there was a rose who was so proud of her beautiful looks. Her only complaint was that she was growing next to an ugly cactus.Every day, the beautiful rose would insult and mock the cactus about his looks, all while the cactus remained quiet. All the other plants nearby tried to make the rose see sense, but she was too swayed by her own looks.One scorching summer, the desert became dry, and there was no water left for the plants. The rose quickly began to wilt. Her beautiful petals dried up, losing their lush color.Looking to the cactus, she saw a sparrow dip his beak into the cactus to drink some water. Though ashamed, the rose asked the cactus if she could have some water. The kind cactus readily agreed, helping them both through the tough summer as friends."),

      story:
          "One day, Molly the milkmaid had filled her pails with milk. Her job was to milk the cows and then bring the milk to the market to sell. Molly loved to think about what to spend her money on.As she filled the pails with milk and went to market, she again thought of all the things she wanted to buy. As she walked along the road, she thought of buying a cake and a basket full of fresh strawberries.A little further down the road, she spotted a chicken. She thought, “With the money I get from today, I’m going to buy my own chicken. That chicken will lay eggs; then I can sell milk and eggs and get more money!”She continued, “With more money, I can buy a fancy dress and make all the other milkmaids jealous.” Out of excitement, Molly started skipping, forgetting about the milk in her pails. Soon, the milk started spilling over the edges, covering Molly.Drenched, Molly said to herself, “Oh no! I will never have enough money to buy a chicken now.” She went home with her empty pails.“Oh, my goodness! What happened to you?” Molly’s mother asked.“I was too busy dreaming about all the things I wanted to buy that I forgot about the pails,” she answered.“Oh, Molly, my dear. How many times do I need to say, ‘Don’t count your chickens until they hatch?’”",

You sold the well to the farmer, did you not?”The neighbor replied, “Birbal, I did sell the well to the farmer but not the water within it.

          "A lone elephant walked through the forest, looking for friends. She soon saw a monkey and asked, “Can we be friends, monkey?”The monkey quickly replied, “You are big and can’t swing on trees like I do, so I cannot be your friend.”Deflated, the elephant continued to search and stumbled across a rabbit. She asked him, “Can we be friends, rabbit?”The rabbit looked at the elephant and replied, “You are too big to fit inside my burrow. You cannot be my friend.”The elephant continued until she met a frog. She asked, “Will you be my friend, frog?”The frog replied, “You are too big and heavy; you cannot jump like me. I am sorry, but you can’t be my friend.”The elephant continued to ask the animals she met on her way but always received the same reply. The following day, the elephant saw all the forest animals run in fear. She stopped a bear to ask what was happening and was told the tiger was attacking all the small animals.The elephant wanted to save the other animals, so she went to the tiger and said, “Please, sir, leave my friends alone. Do not eat them.”The tiger didn’t listen. He merely told the elephant to mind her own business.Seeing no other way, the elephant kicked the tiger and scared him away.
